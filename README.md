 HTML & CSS Practice Projects

This is a collection of mini web
projects built to test and improve my 
HTML and CSS skills. Each folder focuses
on different concepts I'm currently learning.

 Projects

1. Basic Login Form
A simple login form using semantic HTML 
and Flexbox for alignment.

2. Responsive layout page
 A simple page that showcases the use of media
 queries for layout control on multiple screens.

4. CSS Grid Layout
Exploration of CSS Grid to create a more 
advanced layout structure.

5. Multiple page web project  
A project combining Flexbox, Grid, and media 
queries to test everything I've learned so far.

These are beginner-level projects
meant to track my growth. More advanced
work will be added as I continue learning.
